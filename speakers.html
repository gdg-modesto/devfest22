                        Kirsten Villa is an ICS System Administrator with a
                        variety of industry recognized certifications for

                        <br />
                        Kirsten is a successful career changer, having
                        previously worked as an electrician before returning to
                        school for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Post-graduation, she worked as a desktop technician and
                        was promoted numerous times, eventually earning the
                        Regional Lead Technician role. With no more room to grow
                        with that employer, she shifted into Information System
                        Security Officer for Industrial Controls. From there
                        Industrial Controls took center stage, where she
                        combined her IT and ICS knowledge for her current role.

                        <br />
                        Now she is transitioning to her next adventure as a
                        Network Security Engineer.

                        partners, and our internal team of community outreach

                        <br />
                        Floyd joined Bitwise in April of 2020 and enjoys working
                        closely with communities that serve diverse untapped
                        talent, as well as Bitwise’s city-specific team members,
                        who are able to best understand the dynamics of the
                        communities Bitwise hopes to serve.

                        <br />
                        Floyd’s passion is to provide opportunities for folks
                        traditionally left out of tech. His passion is derived
                        from his upbringing in a small community in Northern
                        California, Redding, CA., which is surrounded by a
                        minimal opportunity for growth and upward mobility. He
                        has spent much of his life falling through the cracks of
                        the public school system and spent many years in his
                        youth, in and out of juvenile hall and prison. Floyd is
                        self-taught in reading and writing and understands
                        better than anyone, what it means to first, contribute
                        to the success of others and overcome obstacles, show
                        grit and determination, and find gainful employment in
                        tech.
